# lease
Command-line access to `F_SETLEASE`

```
$ touch q
$ ./lease q rw -- sh -c 'echo Cleanup request && sleep 1 && echo Now clean'&
[1] 28330
$ echo "Before trying to access" && cat q && echo "After tying to access"
Before trying to access
Cleanup request
Now clean
[1]+  Done                    ./lease q rw -- sh -c 'echo Cleanup request && sleep 1 && echo Now clean'
After tying to access
```

Like `flock` tool, can also operate on file descriptors.

# udpfilepecker

Listed UDP port and do two things:

* Periodically send a UDP packet to specified destination (to keep NAT connection alive). The receiver is probably the udppair (see below).
* For each received UDP packet containing two numbers x and y (scanf "%d%d", &x,&y), write y to file descriptor number x.

Also tries to raise it's scheduling priority and lock all pages to memory.

Intended for remotely controlling various /sys/class/{brightness,gpio,pwm}/ knobs in a simplistic way.

# udppair

Listen two UDP ports and exchange information between them. Each reply goes to the lastly received peer address. Something like:

    socat udp-l:1234 udp-l:1235

But it does not "lock in" to one peer.

# udptimeoutchecker

Measure UDP connection timeout in NAT by probing with different delays and testing if connectin still works or not. Server part replies to UDP packets based on timeout in incoming UDP packets. Client checks increasing timeouts until it detects missing reply packets, then "bisects" to find out more exact shut-off delay. Range is from 2 to 512 seconds. There may be running public server on vi-server.org:909 port.
